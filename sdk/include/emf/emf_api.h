/* EMF (Enshrouded Modding Framework) C API, version 20 (see EMF_API_VERSION).
 *
 * A mod is a DLL in <game>/emf/mods/ that exports:
 *     extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) bool emf_mod_load(const EmfApi* api);
 * Return false to report that the mod could not start. The DLL stays loaded either way and anything it
 * registered before returning stays active, so do your checks first. Keep the api pointer; it stays
 * valid for the whole process.
 *
 * Threading rule: ECS data (worlds, components, singletons) may only be touched inside the callbacks
 * registered with on_tick / run_on_world, on the world passed to the callback. They run on the thread
 * that owns that world, right after its simulation step, when no game jobs are running. spawn and
 * destroy enforce this and refuse (with a log line) anywhere else. Component pointers are valid only
 * until the callback returns.
 *
 * Compatibility: fields are only ever appended. Check api->size before using fields added later. Structs with a
 * size field: set it to sizeof(the struct); a newer core accepts the size from any older header (fields added after
 * it keep their defaults).
