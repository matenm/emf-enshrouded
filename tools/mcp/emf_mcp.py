"""EMF MCP server: the debug bridge (docs/modding/debug_bridge.md) as Model Context Protocol tools, so an AI coding
assistant in an MCP client can drive the running game: run console commands, read the state and the log,
wait for a world, take screenshots, press mods' keys and run test scenarios. docs/modding/ai_agents.md explains it.

Standard library only. It speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, one message per line (the MCP stdio transport), and
implements initialize, ping, tools/list and tools/call itself.

    python -I tools/mcp/emf_mcp.py [--game <game folder>] [--pid <game pid>] [--session-file <path>]
                                   [--any-game] [--allow-cloud-world]

The game folder can also come from the environment variable EMF_GAME; without it the server finds the running game
(the way emf_bridge.py does). Every tool call opens its own connection to the game and closes it again, so the game
can be restarted between calls. Errors (no game, a command that did not run, a timeout) come back as tool results
with isError true and plain words, never as a crash.

Reading (hello, state, mods, log, wait, screenshot) works on any game with the bridge on. The tools that change the
game (emf_console, emf_mod_key, emf_run_scenario, emf_load_world) act only:
- on the game scripts\\game_session.ps1 started, as its session file records it (pid and start time; default
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\\EMF\\game_session\\session.json, or EMF_GAME_SESSION); --any-game lifts this for a game you started
  yourself;
- at the main menu or in a LOCAL save (the state's world slot); --allow-cloud-world lifts this.
emf_load_world also checks that the world it started is the LOCAL save it asked for, and ends another one of the
recorded game at once (without saving).
