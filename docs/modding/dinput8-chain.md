# dinput8-chain.ini: a shared spec for loaders

Many Enshrouded mod loaders and DLL mods want to be the game's `dinput8.dll`, and only one file can have that name. A
loader that holds the name starts the other DLLs listed in `dinput8-chain.ini`, next to the game's exe. EMF, Kiln,
ShroudForge, XHL-Core and Auto Loot Plus read this file. This page writes down the rules, so that every loader reads
the file the same way and a player's list works whichever loader holds `dinput8.dll`.

This page is in the public domain (CC0): copy it into your own project's docs, change it, no credit needed. Changes
that more than one loader agrees on are welcome as pull requests to EMF's repository.

The words **must** and **should** below are what a loader that follows this spec does.

## The file

```ini
; my mods
[Chain]
mods\mymod\mymod.dll
autolootplus.dll

[EMF]
creative.dll
```

- **Where:** `dinput8-chain.ini` in the folder of the game's exe (`enshrouded.exe` or `enshrouded_server.exe`).
- **Encoding:** a loader must read UTF-8 with or without a BOM, and UTF-16 LE with a BOM. It should also read the
  system's ANSI code page when the bytes are not valid UTF-8 (a file saved by an old Notepad). A tool that writes the
  file must keep the encoding and line breaks it found.
- **Lines:** blank lines are skipped. A line starting with `;`, `#` or `//` is a comment. `; ` in front of a DLL's line
  switches that DLL off, so players can turn one off without deleting the line. A comment may follow a name after a
  space or tab (`mymod.dll ; my mod`), and a name may stand in double quotes.
- **Sections** (names are not case-sensitive): `[Chain]` is shared: every loader that follows this spec starts its DLLs. Any other section belongs
  to one tool, which names it after itself (`[EMF]`, `[Kiln]`): other loaders must ignore it. Lines before any
  section count as `[Chain]` (older files have no section at all).
- **`key=value` lines:** a line `name=value` counts as a DLL entry when its value names a `.dll`. Other keys are
  settings of the tool that wrote them; other loaders ignore them.

## The DLLs

- **Paths** are relative to the exe's folder. `/` is read as `\`. A loader must refuse absolute paths, drive letters,
  UNC paths (`\\server\...`) and any `..` part: a chain file must not reach outside the game folder.
- **Only `.dll` files.** A line naming anything else is skipped and reported.
- **Never `dinput8.dll` itself**, and a loader must not start another copy of itself. EMF, for example, recognises its
  own loader under another name and does nothing in that copy.
- **Each DLL once.** When a DLL is listed twice (in `[Chain]` and a tool's own section, or twice in one section), it is
  started once, at its first place.
- **Order:** DLLs are started in the order of their lines, top to bottom, `[Chain]` and the loader's own section in the
  order they appear in the file.
- **When:** from the loader's own `DllMain` (or right after it, before any game code runs), with `LoadLibrary`. This is
  the moment a chained DLL would have started had it been `dinput8.dll` itself.
- **At most 256 entries** count. More are reported and skipped.
- **Failures:** a missing DLL, or one that fails to load (Windows' error 126, or 1114 when its `DllMain` failed), is
  skipped and reported. The game goes on.

## Reporting

A loader should log one line per chained DLL: started, skipped (switched off, refused, already loaded) or failed with
Windows' error number. EMF also writes the same as a table to `emf\chain_status.txt`, so players can paste it.

## When you move another tool's dinput8.dll

An installer that finds another tool's `dinput8.dll` should rename it (never delete it), list the new name in its own
section of `dinput8-chain.ini`, and put it back when uninstalled. EMF names it `<tool>.dll` when it recognises the
tool, else after the DLL's version information, else `dinput8-previous.dll`, and records what it moved in
`emf\moved.txt`.

## Exports

The game calls `DirectInput8Create` on whoever holds `dinput8.dll`. The loader must forward that call to Windows' own
`dinput8.dll` (`%SystemRoot%\System32\dinput8.dll`). Chained DLLs do not receive DirectInput calls: a mod that does its
work in `DirectInput8Create` must move it to `DllMain` or a thread it starts.

## Who follows it

| Tool | Reads `[Chain]` | Own section |
|---|---|---|
| EMF | yes (also lines before any section) | `[EMF]` (DLLs its installer renamed) |
| ShroudForge | yes (it wants each entry inside `mods\<folder>\` and reports the others) | |
| Kiln | yes (also lines before any section, quoted names and a comment after a name since 0.2.0-dev.27, and, as an exception to the section rule, `[EMF]`, for DLLs EMF's older installers renamed) | none: its own list is `kiln\chain.ini` |
| XHL-Core, Auto Loot Plus | yes | |

Tell us when your tool reads the file, or reads it differently, and we will update the table.
